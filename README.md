Inspired by [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from backend developer to machine learning engineer.

My main goal was to find an approach to studying Machine Learning that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the Math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because it's the results-first and top-down approach designed for software developers.

Please, feel free to make any contributions you feel will make it better.
