Inspired by [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from backend developer to machine learning engineer.

My main goal was to find an approach to studying Machine Learning that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the Math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because it's the results-first and top-down approach designed for software developers.

Please, feel free to make any contributions you feel will make it better.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
This short section were prerequisites/interesting info I wanted to learn before getting started on the daily plan.

- [ ] [What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Data-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1)
- [ ] [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
- [ ] [Don't Break the Chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
- [ ] [How to learn on your own](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/learn_on_your_own)

## The Daily Plan

Each subject does not require a whole dat to be able to understand it fully, and you can do multiple of these in a day.

Each day I take one subject from the list below, read it cover to cover, take notes, do the exercises and write an implementation in Python or R.
